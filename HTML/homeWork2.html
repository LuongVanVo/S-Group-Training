    <h1>The best motherfucking website</h1>
    <p>For real.</p>
    <h2>Styling?</h2>
    <p>
        You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB
        <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You
        think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
    </p>
    <p>Well, guess what, you're <span class="wr"><u>WRONG</u></span>, motherfucker.</p>
    <h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
    <p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsites</span>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
        <li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
        <li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
        <li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
        <li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>
        <li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
        <li>
            Shit is <i>even more</i> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style with
            out looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website
        </li>
        <li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
        <li>Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</small></li>
        <li>
            It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or
            any other framework. This website is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
        </li>
        <li>Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
        <li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <i>JUST USE IT.</i></li>
        <li>Use <i>some</i> fucking <span class="colored">colors</span></span>.</li>
        <li>
            Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sb">shitty blue</span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="vc">violetish color</span>
            when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="https://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
    <p>
        This website is even better than the last <a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy</a> and the <a href="https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/">guy before him</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's over a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">secure connection</a> - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
        <li>It uses one of the most general <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_top-level_domain">gTLDs</a> available out there: .website</li>
        <li>It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out <a href="https://domainr.com/">domainr</a> to do something cool too.</li>
        <li>It uses the kickass <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)</li>
        <li>It uses <a href="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js">a custom version</a> of the awesome <a href="https://jquery.com/">ultra-lightweight jQuery.</a><b>/s</b></li>
        <li>
            It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is
            outdated they will notice and maybe they will switch from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/internet-explorer-help-23360e49-9cd3-4dda-ba52-705336cc0de2">the crap they use</a> to <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/">a much cooler browser</a>
        </li>
        <li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript <img src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/dd60b11e9762b6e25f6d4ce981a1eeae.svg" alt="JavaScript logo" height="20">, 
            CSS3 <img src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/45e80336c935b524911a6d3f3767448d.svg" alt="CSS3 logo" height = "20"> and HTML5 <img src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/cff75e1839f9200f5b983ebbfbaa65ee.svg" alt="HTML5 logo" height="20"></li>
        <li>Freaks who are scared of JavaScript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered</li>
        <li>It supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/2">HTTP/2</a></li>
        <li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
        <li>It allows universal access from every website via <a href="https://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a></li>
        <li>It is <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">Accessible</a></li>
        <li>It is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>, making it <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/gtld/website/">almost free</a> to keep this website alive</li>
        <li>It's Open Source, freely available on <a href="https://github.com/denysvitali/thebestmotherfuckingwebsite/">GitHub</a>, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
        <li>It uses the <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License</a>, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:
        <p class="fakepre">0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
